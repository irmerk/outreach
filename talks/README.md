- **Abstract**: Many people only have a vague idea of what open source software is or what makes something open source. Many more are familiar, but are not sure how it benefits them in particular or why they should be involved.

In this presentation, we will be explaining some perspectives to take as an individual or manager of a team, and how open source is for anyone to participate in.
