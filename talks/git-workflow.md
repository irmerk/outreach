# Git Workflow Etiquette

## Repository Organization for Clean Codebases

### Level

Beginner - Intermediate

### Length

30min, can be reduced to 10min

### Abstract

Version control with git provides for powerful collaboration, whether it be a tight-knit tech team or a distributed network in an open source format. Still, proper care must be taken. Good quality software consists of, among other things, code which is robust, resilient, secure, and performant. These attributes are achievable by maintaining a foundation of good quality code and a solid history of documentation. Anyone should be able to join the process and easily figure out and track the status of the project.

### Objectives

- Provide strong tools and solutions for working together
- Inspire by showing capabilities of git as version control
- Improve your workflow with concepts shown

### Key Takeaways

Git workflow and collaboration from my experiential perspective with open source. How it can improve the efficiency of the codebase, the experience of its users, and the accessibility for new users.
